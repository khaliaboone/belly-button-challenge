Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard
Project Overview
In this project, we will build an interactive Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard that allows users to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset. This dataset contains information about the types of microbes found in the belly buttons of different people.

What will be done in this project:
Create an interactive dashboard where users can select a sample ID from a dropdown.
Visualize microbial diversity using two charts:
Bar chart: Displays the top microbial species for the selected sample.
Bubble chart: Shows the relative abundance of different species in that sample.
Display sample metadata, including additional details such as age, gender, and ethnicity.
Key Technologies:
Plotly.js: Used to create interactive bar and bubble charts.
D3.js: Used to manipulate and manage the data for the visualizations.
Belly Button Biodiversity Dataset: Provided by UCSD, containing microbial data from belly buttons.
How It Will Work
Dropdown Menu: The user selects a sample ID.
Charts:
The bar chart and bubble chart will update based on the selected sample to show the microbial diversity.
Metadata: Information about the sample (e.g., age, gender) will also update when a new sample is selected.
